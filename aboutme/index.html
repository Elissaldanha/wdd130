    <p>Hi guys, my name is Elis. I'm from the northeast of Brazil, it's very hot here all the time,
        and I like this climate. And no, here in the northeast of Brazil we do not have a lack of water,
        quite the opposite in fact.
        I was born into the gospel, my parents served missions and so did I. I served in the Brazil Manaus Mission
        (green forests) I loved my time in the mission and who I became after serving the Lord.
        I have been married for 5 years, but we still don't have children, we believe that at the right time
        the Lord will bless us with this opportunity.</p>
    <p>I currently serve in 4 church callings, it's exhausting but it's good. This happens here because people
        don't want to serve, it's reality. Does this happen in your city?
        I have a degree in Biology, I have worked as a teacher and I am a specialist in the area of paleontology,
        in which I have worked in museums and working as a researcher in the fields of collecting and identifying
        fossil vertebrates and invertebrates... cool, right? I love paleotology.</p>

        I'm new to the programming area, this is my first contact, and I'm really enjoying it. I love creating
        things, and now I'm realizing that I can use this gift in programming. I hope I can do it hahahah
        I'm a pet mother, I have a 3-year-old border collie, super intelligent, a Labrador and a show dog, I know,
        it's a lot of work to take care of them, but it's good. Does anyone else have a pet?
        I have the dream of being able to live outside my country for a while, to take advantage of opportunities
        and improve my studies and my networking.</p>
    <p>I love the gospel, I know that the church is true and I know that God loves us.
        yours sincerely,
        Elis Figueiredo, your classmate</p>
